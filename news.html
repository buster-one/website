      <dt>07/17/10 Ported to Mac OS X</dt>
      <dd>User Harry Felder has ported weewx to the Mac OS X
        operating system. No source code changes, but he has provided
        a ZIP file that includes a persistent daemon that does the start
        up and shut down of weewx, including after I/O errors. See the
	<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/weewx-user/files">Users&#39; 
	  Group file section</a>.</dd>
      <dt>07/04/10 Version 1.9.0 released</dt>
      <dd>Offers a rudimentary quality
        control: observation values are checked to make sure they lie
        within a specified range. </dd>
      <dt>04/28/10 Version 1.8.0 released</dt>
      <dd>Now offers
        <em>correction expressions</em> for applying calibration corrections
        to your instrument. Added <a href="http://www.wxqa.com/">CWOP</a>
        support. Now saves console battery voltage and transmit battery
        state to the archive.</dd>
      <dt>04/15/10 Version 1.7.0 released</dt>
      <dd>This is a big release with many 
	new features, including support for <em>skins</em>. A skin is a
        collection of the templates, CSS style sheets, GIFs, and other
        items necessary to run a report. This makes it possible to run
        multiple reports against the same skin and put the results in
        different subdirectories. For example, US and Metric versions
        of a report could be produced. Many other new features including
        RSS feeds, support for PWSWeather, support for UTF-8 
	encoding, many new formatting options, <em>etc</em>. See the
	<a href="docs/changes.txt">change log</a>.</dd>
      <dt>03/07/10 Version 1.5.0 released</dt>
      <dd>This new version supports metric 
	units in the presentation layer. It is possible to mix and match
        which units are used for which variables. For example, US Customary
        could be used for all variables except pressure, which could use
        millibars. Other combinations are possible. </dd>
      <dt>02/22/10 Version 1.4.0 released</dt>
      <dd>Changed to a late binding
        architecture for running statistical summaries. Now the SQL
        statements are not run until template evaluation. This reduced
        the memory requirements by one half, made execution slightly
        faster (at least on my server), and simplified the statistics
        code by 150 lines. Added the feature of being able to reread
        the configuration file without stopping the process.</dd>
      <dt>12/22/09 Version 1.3.0 released</dt>
      <dd>The internal architecture of
        weewx was changed. It now consists of an engine that loads and
        manages services. New services can easily be created. This makes
        <span class="code">weewx</span> much easier to customize and extend
        for specialized applications. Posting on the Weather Underground
        is now just another service. Includes a sample new &quot;Alarm&quot;
        service, where an email is sent if an arbitrary expression evaluates
        true. New document on	<a href="docs/customizing.htm">customizing
          <span class="code">weewx</span></a>.</dd>
      <dt>11/27/09 Ported to the
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SheevaPlug">SheevaPlug</a></dt>
      <dd>Mostly, this is just like any other Ubuntu install. Most of the
        effort was in getting the Plug ready.
        <a href="docs/sheeva.htm">Here are my install notes.</a></dd>
      <dt>11/20/09 Version 1.2.0 released</dt>
      <dd>Biggest new features are that it 
	offers progressive vector plots for wind data and improved plot
        scaling.</dd>
