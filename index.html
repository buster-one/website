	<span class="code">weewx</span> is a free, open source, software
	program, written in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>,
	which interacts with your weather station to produce graphs,
	reports, and HTML pages. It can optionally publish to weather sites
	or web servers. It uses modern software concepts, making it simple,
	robust, and easy to extend. It includes extensive
        <a href="support.html">documentation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	<span class="code">weewx</span> runs under most versions of Linux,
	as well as Mac OS X and Solaris. Many users are running on the
        <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. The images on
	this page and throughout this web site are from
        <a href="showcase.html">sample stations</a> running
        <span class="code">weewx</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Thousands of stations throughout the world run
        <span class="code">weewx</span>,
	many of whom have opted-in to be shown on our
        <a href="stations.html">station map</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Key features:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Support for <a href="hardware.html">many popular
	    weather stations</a>;
	</li>
	<li>Uploads to popular weather sites including
          <a href="http://www.wunderground.com">WeatherUnderground</a>,
          <a href="http://www.pwsweather.com/">PWSweather.com</a>,

      <p>
	I wrote <span class="code">weewx</span> over the winter of 2008-2009
	for two reasons: it was a wet and miserable winter here in Oregon
	with not much else to do, so there was no good reason not to, and
	because I wanted a simple, easy-to-understand server to run my Davis
	VantagePro2 weather station on a Linux box. I had been using
        <a href="http://www.wviewweather.com/">wview</a>, which is a
	high-performance and feature rich system authored by Mark Teel with
	lots of users. Written in C, it is an efficient system that can run
	on underpowered boxes. In exchange, it is huge (45,000+ lines of
	code), tightly integrated in with its companion library, radlib
	(another 14,000+ lines), and very complex, making it difficult to
	understand and reliably customize. I wanted something more modern
	and much, much simpler.
      </p>
      <p>Having made a career in C++ and Java, I was also interested in
	some more modern languages, so I thought I would try either Python
	or Ruby (although, truth be told, the roots of Python are nearly as
	old as C++!). I ended up picking Python because its libraries are
	more mature and there are many mores choices for third party
	libraries.</p>
      <p>
	<span class="code">Weewx</span> is about 8,500 lines of code (plus
	2,500 for the experimental driver for the LaCrosse WS28xx series,
	which was machine translated), with another 6,200 comment lines.
	Because it is pure Python, it requires no makefiles, no builds, no
	special installs. It offers very powerful configuration and
	templating options, as well as an internally extensible engine,
	making it easy to customize. Its internal modular design and use of
	modern exception handling make it very robust and difficult to
	crash. It is also architecturally very simple and easy to
	understand.
      </p>
      <p>Right now, it is Unix only. I have not tried porting to
	Microsoft Windows, but given the portability of Python it is likely
	to be a large, but not mammoth, project.</p>
      
      <h2><a href="wunderfixer">wunderfixer</a></h2>
      <p>The <a href="wunderfixer">wunderfixer</a> is a
        utility for users of <span class="code">weewx</span>
        or <span class="code">wview</span> that will compare
        data in a local sqlite database with data at the
        <a href="wunderground.com">Weather Underground</a>,
        then optionally republish the missing data.
